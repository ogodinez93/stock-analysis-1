## Summary

### Advantages And Disadvantages Of Refactoring

The main advantage of refactoring code in general is that it can streamline code that is though functional, to a more efficient processing of data. Streamlining can make the code more readable and thus simpler to debug. Understandability in code is important for sustainability. Simple changes to bad code can reduce the need entirely for debugging. 

Sometimes code is better left alone. It may not be timely nor productive to refactor code if it is up against time or financial constraints. 

### Advantages And Disadvantages of The Original and Refactored VBA Script

The code is more efficient with the use of an array as opposed to nested for loops to accomplish the same task within the program. The time to complete identical tasks with each is bested by a factor 7 to in when the array is used.



The code is easier to understand providing one understands the differences in the way the data is processed using each method.
